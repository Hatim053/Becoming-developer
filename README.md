# 🌱 My MERN Development Journey

Welcome to my **MERN Stack Learning Journey** repository!  
This is where I document my daily progress, lessons, and insights as I learn and grow as a full-stack web developer — from **scratch**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I created this repo to:

- Keep my **daily learning notes** organized and accessible  
- Stay **accountable** throughout my journey  
- Record what I learn each day — step by step  
- Share my progress and resources with others who are learning too  

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- 📘 **Daily Logs:** My day-by-day learning notes  
- 💻 **Code Snippets & Examples:** Small experiments or practice tasks  
- 🧩 **Concept Breakdowns:** Explanations of key MERN topics (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)  
- 🔗 **Helpful Resources:** Links to tutorials, docs, and references I used  

---

## 🚀 Journey Goal

To **master full-stack development** using the **MERN stack**, build real-world projects, and gain deep understanding of both **frontend and backend**.

---

## 🗓️ How I’m Tracking Progress

I’m recording every learning day — like a journal:  
- `Day 1` → Setting up basics  
- `Day 2` → JavaScript fundamentals  
- `Day 30` → Working with APIs  
- `Day 60+` → Express, MongoDB, and beyond...

---

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

This isn’t just about learning syntax — it’s about **building discipline**, **understanding deeply**, and **becoming a better developer** one day at a time.
