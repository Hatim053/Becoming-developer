Impure Function : (1) functions that changes the variables outside their scope while execution
                  (2) functions that doesn't gurantee same output for the same input
Example : 
let count = 0;
function increment() {
    count++; // modifies variable outside it's scope
}           

function add(num) {
    return num + Math.random(); // doesn't gurantee same output for same input
}
