seTimeout and SetInterval can use predefined function as a callback function. we only have to pass the refrence of the function.

let z = setInterval(printHello , 1000 , "Hatim");  setInterval can use 3 parameters third paramter is the paramter for refrenced / callback function because we can't directly pass the paramter to callback function because we are justing passing the refrence not invoking.

// callback
passing one function into another function as an argument.
nesting of too many callback function can decrease the code readibility it is sometime also termed as callback hell or pyramid of doom.
