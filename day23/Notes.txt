                                                    (A) call()
Call() - lets you run a function with a specific this value and arguments in simple words  it helps to you tranfer the context of one object into  another function

function setUsername(username) {
    this.username = username;
}
function createUser(username , age) {
    setUsername(username); // in this case username won't set because we are not holding the reference
    setUsername.call(this , username); // now we passed our own context into setUsername so this keyword in setUsername will refer to createUser
    this.age = age;
}
const user1 = new createUser("Hatim" , 22);
console.log(user1);

                                                      (B)
