                                               (A) Virtual Dom : 
1) When react components initially render react creates Virtual dom tree that is  a copy of the actual dom 
2) whenever there is any changes in the component state , props instead of directly implementing it into actual dom it creates a new virtual dom and then compares the new one with the old one .
3) then it only updates the changed values instead of recreating the the whole dom



                                               (B) Reconciliation : 
 algorithm react uses to differentiate previosly contructed virtual dom with the newly constructed virtual dom    to determine the changes occurred.


                                                  (C) React Fibre (introduce in React 16)

A react algorithm that decides how and when to update the ui.  before react fibre react use stack-based-reconcilar where the problem was if the rendering started react won't stop it until it gets finished but react fibre overcomes this and it provides controllable rendering where we can , pause assign priority , reuse and abort the work.


                                                  (D)props (properties)
through props we can pass data from parent component to child component , this is the similar concept as passing arguments inside functions while calling them
